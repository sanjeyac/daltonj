# DaltonJ

DaltonJ is a Daltonism Simulator for Accessibily Analisys.

It uses the great filters of ColorOracle on given images (https://github.com/nvkelso/color-oracle-java).

Analisys can be done using making screenshots, pasting from clipboards and loading from files.

Currently four types of filters have been implemented: Deuteranopia, Protanopia, Tritanopia and Grayscale.
